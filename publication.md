 - L-SHADE was a first ranked method at the CEC2014 Competition on Real-Parameter Single Objective Optimization (link).
 - Originally submitted source code of L-SHADE 1.0.0: (C++ code)
 - Please note that this C++ code (also available at the competition website) was submitted to the CEC2014 competition. However, this code had a bug in the archive update mechanism which resulted in a slight performance degradation, but all constraints were satisfied and all solutions found were valid. - For better results, please use the corrected version below:
  - Fixed source code of L-SHADE 1.0.1: (C++ code), (Matlab/Octave code), (Java code)
  - Fixed source code of SHADE 1.1.1: (C++ code), (Matlab/Octave code), (Java code)
