## Short Biography

I am currently a research assistant professor at Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech) with Prof. Hisao Ishibuchi. Previously, during 2016 to 2017, I was a postdoctoral researcher at Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) with Prof. [Akira Oyama](http://ladse.eng.isas.jaxa.jp/). Before that, in 2016, I received the Ph.D. degree in Science from The University of Tokyo, under the supervision of [Prof. Alex Fukunaga](http://metahack.org/index.html). I also received the B.S. and M.S degree in Engineering from Sophia University.
